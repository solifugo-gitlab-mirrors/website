### Who am i?
Hi, I'm Alessio Giovannini, I was born in Rome in 1994, I have a Computer Science Bachelor Degree @ [La Sapienza](https://www.studiareinformatica.uniroma1.it/).

During my university days I had the opportunity to learn various academic notions; the most important are the study of algorithms and data structures, networks and computer architecture and the functioning of operating systems. I also had the opportunity to work in a team on various academic projects, making use of the techniques and rules of software engineering. I consider myself an extremely curious person with the constant desire to improve both socially and technically.
